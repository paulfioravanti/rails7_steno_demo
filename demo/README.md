# Steno Demo Artefacts

This directory contains the following files:

- [Demo script][]: This is what I used as my guide through the demo. It has
  information about talking points, what code/text I should write at what point,
  as well as what [snippets][] I should use, and what [steno outlines][] I
  should use for certain words.
- [Tape Output][]: This is the unedited output of all the steno keystrokes I
  made during the demo. If you would like more information on how to actually
  read the output, [Stanley Sakai][]'s video [Stan's Quick and Dirty: How
  Stenography Works][] is a _fantastic_ primer for this, as well as being a
  great introduction to stenography in general.
